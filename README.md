## App Description
The goal of this app is so users can get the chance to experience what itâ€™s like being a scientist without needing background knowledge, money or time. As long as they are curious about something and/or want to note down discoveries they make, the app will provide a place to do so.

An example might be using the app to take pictures of animals they see in their neighbourhood. Over time, they might observe some sort of pattern (like a particular species thriving) and they can continue making observations to verify their thoughts.

Users will also get the chance to see what other users are posting about and if interested, follow them or a particular topic so they get notified of the newest discoveries.

## Complexity Points
| Complexity | Points | Envisioned Usage |
| ------------- |-------------| -------------|
| PWA with the use of service and web workers | 2 | Allowing users to "download" the app on thier phone and make use of the features even without internet connection |
| Push API | 3 | Sending notifications for new postings from other users or topics that the user follows |
| Auth0 | 1 | Authorization and authentication purposes |
| Unovis | 1 | Interactive map that users can add posts and filter posts |

Currently, no bonus complexity points are planned. However, if we decide on having new features that require additional complexity, then they will be included below.
